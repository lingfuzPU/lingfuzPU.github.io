We consider directed last passage percolation on \(\mathbb{{Z}}^2\) with exponential passage times on the vertices. A topic of great interest is the coupling structure of the weights of geodesics between points as they are varied in space and time with various initial conditions with a particular case of importance being the flat initial data which corresponds to line-to-point last passage times. Settling a conjecture by Ferrari and Spohn (SIGMA 2016), we show that for the passage times from the line \(x+y=0\) to the points \((r,r)\) and \((n,n)\), denoted \(X_{r}\) and \(X_{n}\) respectively, as \(n\to \infty\) and \(\frac{r}{n}\) is small but bounded away from zero, the covariance satisfies \(\mbox{Cov}(X_{r},X_{n})=\Theta((\frac{r}{n})^{4/3+o(1)} n^{2/3})\), thereby establishing \(4/3\) as the temporal covariance exponent. This differs from the corresponding exponent for the droplet initial condition recently rigorously established in Ferrari and Occelli (2018), Basu and Ganguly (2018), and requires novel arguments. Key ingredients include the understanding of geodesic geometry and recent advances in quantitative comparison of geodesic weight profiles to Brownian motion using the Brownian Gibbs property. The proof methods are expected to be applicable for a wider class of initial data.

In this note, 
we study the model of directed last passage percolation on \(\mathbb{{Z}}^2\), with i.i.d. exponential weight.
We consider the maximum paths from vertices \(\left(0, \left\lfloor k^{2/3} \right\rfloor\right)\) and \(\left(\left\lfloor k^{2/3} \right\rfloor, 0\right)\) to \((n, n)\), respectively.
For the coalescing point of these paths, 
we show that the probability for it being \(kR\) far away from the origin is in the order of \(R^{-2/3}\).
This is motivated by a recent work of Basu, Sarkar, and Sly, where the same estimate was obtained for semi-infinite geodesics, and the optimal exponent for the finite case was left open.

<i>
In the slow bond problem the rate of a single edge in the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) is reduced from 1 to \(1-\varepsilon\). Janowsky and Lebowitz posed the question of whether such very small perturbations could affect the macroscopic current. Different groups of physicists, using a range of heuristics and numerical simulations reached opposing conclusions on whether the critical value of \(\varepsilon\) is 0. This was ultimately resolved rigorously by Basu-Sidoravicius-Sly which established that \(\varepsilon_c=0\).
<br>
Here we study the effect of the current as \(\varepsilon\) tends to 0 and in doing so explain why it was so challenging to predict on the basis of numerical simulations. In particularly we show that the current has an infinite order phase transition at 0, with the effect of the perturbation tending to 0 faster than any polynomial. Our proof focuses on the Last Passage Percolation formulation of TASEP where a slow bond corresponds to reinforcing the diagonal. We give a multiscale analysis to show that when \(\varepsilon\) is small the effect of reinforcement remains small compared to the difference between optimal and near optimal geodesics. Since geodesics can be perturbed on many different scales, we inductively bound the tails of the effect of reinforcement by controlling the number of near optimal geodesics and giving new tail estimates for the local time of (near) geodesics along the diagonal.

<b>Shift-Invariance of the Colored TASEP and Finishing Times of the Oriented Swap Process</b>

<i>
We prove a new shift-invariance property of the colored TASEP. It is in the same spirit as recent results of Borodin-Gorin-Wheeler, Dauvergne, and Galashin, while out of the scope of the generality of their methods. Our proof takes shift-invariance of the colored six-vertex model as an input, and uses analyticity of the probability functions and induction arguments. We apply our shift-invariance to prove a distributional identity between the finishing times of the oriented swap process and the point-to-line passage times in exponential last-passage percolation, which is conjectured by Bisi-Cunden-Gibbons-Romik and Bufetov-Gorin-Romik, and is also equivalent to a purely combinatorial identity in relation with the Edelman-Greene correspondence. With known results from last-passage percolation, this also implies new asymptotic results on the finishing times of the oriented swap process.

A well-known question in the planar first-passage percolation model concerns the convergence of the empirical distribution along geodesics.
We demonstrate this convergence for an explicit model, directed last-passage percolation on \(\mathbb{Z}^2\) with i.i.d. exponential weights, and provide explicit formulae for the limiting distributions, which depend on the asymptotic direction.
For example, for geodesics in the direction of the diagonal, the limiting weight distribution has density \((1/4+x/2+x^2/8)e^{-x}\), and so is a mixture of Gamma(1,1), Gamma(2,1) and Gamma(3,1) distributions with weights 1/4, 1/2, and 1/4 respectively.
More generally, we study the local environment as seen from vertices along the geodesics 
(including information about the shape of the path and about the weights on and off the path
in a local neighborhood). 
We consider finite geodesics from (0,0) to \(n\boldsymbol{\rho}\) for some vector \(\boldsymbol{\rho}\) in the first quadrant, in the limit as \(n\to\infty\), as well as the semi-infinite geodesic in direction \(\boldsymbol{\rho}\).
We show almost sure convergence of the empirical
distributions along the geodesic, as well as convergence of the distribution around a typical point, and we give an explicit description of the limiting distribution. 
<br>
We make extensive use of a correspondence
with TASEP as seen from a single second-class
particle for which we prove new results concerning
ergodicity and convergence to equilibrium. 
Our analysis relies  on geometric arguments involving estimates for the last-passage time, available from the integrable probability literature.

<b>Mean Field Behavior during the Big Bang for Coalescing Random Walk</b>

<i>In this paper we consider the coalescing random walk model on general graphs \(G=(V,E)\).
We set up a unified framework to study the leading order of decay rate  of \(P_t\), the expectation of the fraction of occupied sites at time $t$, particularly for the `Big Bang' regime where \(t \ll t_{coal}:=\mathbb{E}[\inf\{s:\text{There is only one particle at time }s \}]\).
Our results show that \(P_t\) satisfies certain `mean field behavior', if the graphs satisfy certain `transience-like' conditions.
<br>
We apply this framework to two families of graphs: (1) graphs given by configuration model with degree \(\ge 3\), and (2) finite and infinite vertex-transitive graphs.
In the first case, we show that for \(1 \ll t \ll |V|\), \(P_t\) decays in the order of \(t^{-1}\), and \((tP_t)^{-1}\) is approximately the probability that two particles starting from the root of the corresponding unimodular Galton-Watson tree never collide after one of them leaves the root, which is also roughly \(|V|/(2t_{meet})\), where \(t_{meet}\) is the mean meeting time of two independent walkers.
By taking the local weak limit, for the corresponding unimodular Galton-Watson tree we prove convergence of \(tP_t\) as \(t\to\infty\). 
For the second family of graphs, if we take a growing sequence of finite vertex-transitive graphs \(G_n=(V_n, E_n)\), such that \(t_{meet}=O(|V_n|)\), and the inverse of the spectral gap \(t_{rel}\) is \(o(|V_n|)\), we show for 
\(t_{rel} \ll t \ll t_{coal}\), \((tP_t)^{-1}\) is approximately the probability that two random walks never meet before time \(t\), and also \(|V|/(2t_{meet})\).
In addition, we define a certain natural `uniform transience' condition, and show that in the transitive setup it implies the above for all \(1 \ll t\ll t_{coal}\).
Such estimates of \(tP_t\) are also obtained for all infinite transient transitive unimodular graphs, in particular, all transient transitive amenable graphs.</i>

<i>We study maximal length collections of disjoint paths, or `disjoint optimizers', in the directed landscape. We show that disjoint optimizers always exist, and that their lengths can be used to construct an extended directed landscape. The extended directed landscape can be built from an independent collection of extended Airy sheets, which we define via last passage percolation across the Airy line ensemble. We show that the extended directed landscape and disjoint optimizers are scaling limits of the corresponding objects in Brownian last passage percolation. As two consequences of this work, we show that one direction of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth bijection passes to the KPZ limit, and we find a criterion for geodesic disjointness in the directed landscape that uses only a single Airy line ensemble.</i>

<i>We study the ferromagnetic Ising model on the infinite \(d\)-regular tree under the free boundary condition. This model is known to be a factor of IID  in the uniqueness regime, when the inverse temperature \(\beta\ge 0\) satisfies \(\tanh \beta \le (d-1)^{-1} \). However, in the reconstruction regime (\(\tanh \beta > (d-1)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\) ), it is not a factor of IID. We construct a factor of IID for the Ising model beyond the uniqueness regime via a strong solution to an infinite dimensional stochastic differential equation which partially answers a question of Lyons. The solution \(\{X_t(v) \}\) of the SDE is distributed as \(X_t(v) = t\tau_v + B_t(v)\), where \(\{\tau_v \}\) is an Ising sample and \(\{B_t(v) \}\) are independent Brownian motions indexed by the vertices in the tree. Our construction holds whenever \(\tanh \beta \le c(d-1)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\), where \(c>0\) is an absolute constant.</i>
