<H2>Course description</H2>
<hr>
<br>

The William Lowell Putnam Mathematics Competition (by the Mathematical Association of America, <a href="https://maa.org/putnam/">Official Website</a>) is the most prestigious annual contest for college students. While the problems only employ machinery from the standard undergraduate curriculum, the ability to solve them requires a great deal of ingenuity. This can be developed through systematic training, and this class aims to assist the interested students in the preparation for the Putnam exam. Beyond the competition, problem-solving is an essential skill in many disciplines, so at the same time we will use the contest as an excuse to develop this ability through challenging and fun problems. Our aim is to use the competition problems to provide a tour through many interesting topics, and to expose a bridge to higher mathematics.
<br>
<br>


The 86th Putnam Competition will take place on Saturday, December 6th, 2025. Register (<a href="">link</a> for Caltech students) now if you think that there is a chance you will participate.
<br>
<br>
For more information about the Putnam competition and this course, see <a href="course/CaltechMA1725FA/Handout0.pdf">Handout 0</a>.

<H3>Grading and Collaboration</H3> 
You are expected to attend classes and problem sessions, and submit problem sets (through Canvas). You should hand in <b>carefully written solutions to exactly three problems</b> for each assignment. Problem sets will usually contain more problems, and you are encouraged to work on more than three for your own enjoyment, but they will not be graded.
<br>
<br>
Your main goal in this class should be to develop the largely individual skill of problem-solving. Therefore, collaboration on homework before you have solved at least three problems on your own is <b>discouraged, though not strictly forbidden</b>. You should make a serious effort to work through each problem independently before turning to classmates, the internet, or tools like ChatGPT.
<br>
<br>
<b>Final Grade</b> Pass/Fail. Based on 15% participation + 40% problem sets + 45% mock Putnam. 
<br>
<b>Late policy</b> Late problem sets will not be accepted.

<H3>The key resource</H3>
The <a href="">Putnam Archive</a> by Kiran Kedlaya. This page contains all the problems and solutions of previous Putnam exams.
